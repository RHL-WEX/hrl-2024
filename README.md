# Ruihang Liu

üéì Computer Science Graduate | Boston University (Bachelor‚Äôs + Master‚Äôs in Dec ‚Äô24)
üë®‚Äçüíª Software Engineer with a Passion for Distributed Systems, Embedded Systems, Cloud and Scalable Solutions

Looking for Full time 2025


### Hi:

I‚Äôm Ruihang Liu (pronounced ‚ÄúRay-Hung Leo‚Äù), a soon-to-be graduate in Computer Science from Boston University, where I‚Äôve developed deep expertise across a range of technical disciplines‚Äîincluding distributed systems, backend development, scalable API design, and full-stack applications.

### üõ† Technical Skills and Experience

I‚Äôve honed my skills in developing efficient, fault-tolerant systems through both academic projects and industry internships. My experience includes:
* Building a RESTful API service layer from scratch for [MovieDate](https://github.com/hrl-2024/MovieDate/tree/main/backend), with detailed documentation that streamlined frontend-backend collaboration.
* Optimizing large datasets and minimizing response times from minutes to seconds for iQiyi using a custom, multi-threaded MapReduce-inspired solution.
* Developing robust, networked systems with SQL databases, Flask, Spring Boot, and Docker in Unix/Linux environments.

### üåê Real-World Problem Solver

From internships to hackathons, I‚Äôve tackled real-world engineering challenges and optimized solutions. I‚Äôm proficient in Python, Go, and Java, and am currently sharpening my skills in runtime analysis and dynamic programming techniques to ensure my code is both effective and scalable.

### üöÄ Future Aspirations

I‚Äôm especially excited about opportunities in cloud computing, distributed systems, and carbon-reducing technology‚Äîsectors where my technical skills and adaptability can make a real impact. My recent engagements with companies like Crusoe and Tailscale have only strengthened my drive to work on projects with meaningful implications, whether through efficient resource use or innovative applications in cloud infrastructure.

### üì´ Let‚Äôs Connect!

If you‚Äôre looking for a proactive, solution-focused developer, feel free to reach out! I‚Äôm eager to connect with industry professionals and explore opportunities that allow me to grow and contribute as a Software Engineer.
